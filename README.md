## Setup

### 1. Get the source code

```sh
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/lipeprado/rr-prod <your-app>
$ cd <your-app>
```

You will probably want to remove ARc git history and start a brand new repository:

```sh
$ rm -rf .git
$ git init
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

### 3. Run the app

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

It will start the development server with [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement) on top of it.

> [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) â€” Development server<br>

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser and start developing.

### 4. Run the tests

Just run tests:

```sh
$ npm run test
```

Run coverage

```sh
$ npm run coverage
```

#### 5. Run Build Production

Run env "Production"

```sh
$ npm run env:prod
```

Run Build Production

```sh
$ npm run build

Let's Code.
